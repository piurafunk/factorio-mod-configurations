[mod-setting-description]
space-exploration-configuration-space-belt-speed=Vanilla transport belt speed increases by 15 items/second per tier. This setting allows specifying the speed of Space Transport Belts. Defaults to 60, which follows the same progression as the vanilla transport belts (+15 items/second per tier).
space-exploration-configuration-underground-space-belt-max-distance=Vanilla underground belt maximum distance increases by 2 tiles/tier. This setting allows specifying the maximum distance of Space underground belt. Defaults to 10, which follows the same progression as the vanilla underground belts (+2 tiles/tier).
space-exploration-configuration-underground-deep-space-belt-max-distance=Vanilla underground belt maximum distance increases by 2 tiles/tier. The default Space Exploration value is 17, which isnn't really in line with any of the upgrades. This default is also 17, but is provided for modification to match other mods' progression (such as Krastorio2).
space-exploration-configuration-space-assembling-machine-speed=Vanilla assembling machine speed increases by +.25 per tier, cumulitive (+0.25, +0.50). This setting allows specifying the speed of the Space Assembling Machine (not Space Manufactory). Defaults to 2.0 (+0.75 on top of Assembling Machine 3, which has a default speed of 1.25), which follows the same progression as the vanilla assembling machines.
space-exploration-configuration-space-pipe-to-ground-max-distance=Vanilla Pipe to ground has a distance of 10 (a gap of 9, the 10th tile is the out of ground entity). This setting allows specifying the max distance of Space pipe to ground. Defaults to 10, which matches vanilla pipe to ground.
